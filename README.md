# text-match
TextMatch is a library for matching text strings against Lucene query expressions. If you have a large collection of text strings, and you need to find out which ones match certain text patterns - TextMatch can help! For this type of requirement, TextMatch is easier to use than regular expressions.

## Usage
See the TextMatch.Tests project
